Ultimate Tag Warrior provides all of your tagging needs,  in a Whacky,  pre-Wordpress tags world.  This plugin will not work with Wordpress 2.3.

== Description ==

The Ultimate Tag Warrior (UTW) is designed for WordPress sites to increase the possibilities and functions for tagging posts and expanding site navigation through the creation of lists of tags. It allows storing a set of keywords (current slang calls these "tags") against posts that behave like categories - the tags can be displayed on a post as links, and when clicked, the visitor is taken to an archive page for that tag. There are also RSS/atom feeds available for each tag. Unlike categories, for example, you can also view archive pages and feeds for sets of tags such as the posts which are tagged with both "photograph" and "food".

Beyond the category-like behaviour, Ultimate Tag Warrior plugin provides ways of getting an overview of your tags through tag clouds and graphic representation such as a long tail graph and/or weighted bar arrangement. UTW can also be coaxed into linking to other tag-savvy websites such as del.icio.us, Flickr and Technorati.
